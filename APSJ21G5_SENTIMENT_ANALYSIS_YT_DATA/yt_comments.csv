All these people that are saying you should say what ever you want are also trump supporters.
Always intriguing to me to see how some people get so upset over other people's choice of phone.
Am I the only person who finds the shape of the screen unappealing? It looks like the screen has ears.
AMAZING!
And no 128gb. 64gb and then 256. Ridiculous. Anyway... not upgrading.
And Seth Rogen AS..... Seth Rogen
And so far he has succeeded
And this could in all honestly become a good thing for you. You sit on a platform where you could really educate people especially when so many of your fans seem to think it's okay to be said. Really learn about the history of the word and come back to us if you can because you could really help educate people and that's powerful.
And this guy is a brain surgeon; wonder how many lawsuits against him?  He's despicable!
Android has done this already not original

"apple claims this is the first OLED screen which is good enough for the iPhone..... but it's a lesser screen to the S8 and G6.... and the claim is bullshit, the thing about this good enough stuff is about profit margins...."
Apple disabled the comments... Cowards
Apple doing a good job copying Samsung but whatever happened to being innovative? This is just overpriced android with an apple logo.
Apple is really starting to fall off. Galaxy S8 is tops right now next to the Galaxy Note 8.
Apple went full retard

"As a Black American, I don't think it's that big of a deal. I haven't even seen the clip but from what I've heard and from what I know about Pewds from watching him for years, I can conclude it wasn't meant to be offensive. Lots of the time the word is used now (or its variants), it's not meant to be racist or worth getting offended over. Although, I don't get why people have this weird obsession with saying it. While context does matter, regardless, it's a word with a shitty history and unnecessary to use. When people have a fixation with the word it weirds me out and makes me think they're closet racists. Do people think it's edgy or something? (I'm talking primarily about nigger, not nigga because that word has a totally different connotation)"

Ben Carson - someone dumber and stranger than Donald - hard to believe
Ben Carson could screw up a one car funeral
Ben Carson doesn't believe in the policies of HUD *Continue to show commentators criticizing him but don't give any policy arguments or even show Dr. Carson explaining what he believes*
Ben Carson is a idiot. But what else is to expect from a American?
Ben Carson is clearly writing his own prescriptions
Ben Carson is proof that a person can be a neurosurgeon and somehow still be stupid as hell.
BEN CARSON IS THE MAN!!!!! THEY HATE HIM CAUSE HE EXPOSED HITLARY'S RITUAL ABUSE ON CHILDREN!!!!!!!
Ben carson on paper looked like a put together fella. Then he started talking on tv. Now we all know there is something terribly wrong with HIS BRAIN.
Ben Carson!!!!!!\nGood God!!
Ben Carson's stupidity still hasn't failed to shock me.

Ever since Steve jobs passed away Iphone has gone to shit.  Iphones use to be sooo good. Like seriously wireless charging now? Samsung implemented it 2 generation ago with the S6 lmao xD
Everybody says that when u play call of duty and other games it's immature but can be over looked by great people it takes someone low to sit and fight about it it's life man
EVERYONE holds their phone by the sides....WHY THE FUCK is the power button on the side instead of the top to prevent accidental pressing and having to unlock the phone AGAIN!?!?!?!   (super major gripe with every phone out there....designers are morons)

"He has it all, Good look Many frends and also maybe Jonny is Vampyre"
He talking about how we changed logging Forever on his own channel should be a lot more humbling if somebody else made this video instead of you know Logan Paul make it a video about how Logan Paul change login forever you didn't change shit if anything you just exposed a large audience of five to 10 year olds maybe even freshman in high school that like your videos people that you can hook up with or fuck really sad and it's really pathetic how your entire audience is made up of these people nobody can actually buy or afford anything without asking their parents that's exactly who your audience is

Hi doggy
"Hi Felix. As an newly subscriber and a fan, I didn't see the bit your apologizing for on your channel but heard the douchebag Sargon of Akkad (not a fan) mentioned it on his channel, where he's clearly stating that it's more then ok to use that particular word if one is not a racist and actually said it multiple times. You clarly have more integrity and a higher moral character then he has and as a Albanien-Swed, am verry proud of you for apologizing. Big UP Brah!"
hi first
"Hi, if your reading this, I just want you to have a good day. I have a small channel with very few subscribers, but I'll really appreciate it if you gave my videos a chance. Sorry to bother you"

"HUMANS MAKE MISTAKES\n\nIF YOU HAVENT MADE THEM, YOU ARENT HUMAN."
I am asking a girl to shine coming to day with me luck
i am convinced a large percentage of PewDiePie's audience are 12 year old white boys who think they are edgy by saying the N word.
"I am not angry at you at all.  And you shouldn't have to apologize.  The way I see it, if it's such a bad word then NO ONE should be using it.  Not just white people.  I support you Pewds!"
"I am seeing so much idiocy and lack of self awareness in these comments. Let me hit you all with some knowledge: the N word is not okay to say because it has body counts and a huge amount of human suffering attached to it. The word goes back to slave owning days, same as the N word with no hard r. Black folks can say the word because it is theirs to reclaim. I'm a person of color and that word is not in my vocabulary. Why? Because I'm not black, and I'm aware of the oppression tied to this word. I'm also not a piss baby arguing why I should be able to use such a gross word because again, this word is not mine to reclaim. So yeah, it's fine when all these black rappers use the word because it's a part of their personal history. As a grown ass woman I am still in disbelief that people can't have a pinch of empathy for their fellow human beings. If you're not black, you are irrelevant in the conversation of whether you can say the n word. You can't, bottom line, and if you're still arguing your right to say it, well then I have news for you: you're a racist."
I am so bombed I can't go on Twitter
I am so excited.
"I am very happy for this man and we need to spread more love. United we stand, divided we fall."
I bet you only 10% of the people getting triggered by him saying the n word are actually black.
"I can sympathize with Ben Carson for being a scatterbrain, but not for his agenda."
I can't believe he was a doctor
I can't wait til Cora can play with everyoneâ˜ºï¸
I couldâ€™ve sworn we asked for group FaceTime call .
"I defended pewds the last racist thing he did. Pewds isn't racist, that's just his inappropriate, dark humor. There's no need to be sensitive, but if you're accidentally racist on several occasions it's not an accident and you're actually racist. I've never ever said the n word, because from a white person that's a terribly hurtful word, and with the black family members that I have, I would never want my young cousins to hear the word that came out of this mans mouth, especially since he's an influencer. Now I'm going to be hearing it more, and then hear well pewdiepie said it, so can I. It's not okay, and it's not something you say in the heat of the moment, it only slips out if you frequently say it. I think I gotta give up on defending this. I've been subscribed for like 6 years. And it's time to say farewell."
I did nooooooot
I did not hit her \nI did naaaaaaaaht
I donâ€™t really like the no home button :(( I like Touch ID more then this face id
I Done! I'm going back to flip phones! Where can I buy a Motorola RAZR?
"I don't get it. Since it has 3D Touch, why didn't Apple incorporate a hard press at the bottom of the screen to go home? Swipe seems less intuitive."
I don't have twitter â˜¹ï¸
I don't know if I have seen anything more spot on in my life
I don't know wether to laugh or cry anymore when I see these clips...
"I don't see it as racist, but rather as an accident"
i downloaded and saw The Mummy 2017  in the best quality guys. here's the Iink https://twitter.com/akewdiudri/status/907980087676477442\nyou must see too guys! that was awesome.
"I feel like with no home button, you're constantly going to accidentally open the 4 apps at the bottom of the screen."
"I felt that Country wore it better.  And he looked safer.  Roman, you were stick legs with a padded jacket.  Where was your head covering??!!"
I forgive you but man i can you blame people for saying the n word we say it ourselves
I forgot Ben Carson existed
"I forgot that pewdiepie's fandom is a majority white people ðŸ˜’.\n IF ðŸ‘ YOU'RE ðŸ‘ WHITE ðŸ‘ DONT ðŸ‘ TELL ðŸ‘ POC ðŸ‘ HOW ðŸ‘ THEY ðŸ‘ SHOULD ðŸ‘ FEEL ðŸ‘. Our ancestors paid for that word with their own blood, so poc today can use it how ever we want. You cannot tell us how we should feel. Y'all are disgusting for backing up your problematic fave and I'm pretty sure he did this before. Pewdiepie is canceled."
I forgot what happened to the razor
I go out of my way to dislike every single one your videos
I got a eyedeah for a hat style u can do a rainbow hat with the word smile more logo
I got accepted into hardboard with an IQ of 43 at the age of 45
I got jabs today at school and my arm is really saw
I hate people who always edit their comments.
I have a question. Where's the... luggage! Someone took his luggage :(. Ahhhhhhh
"I have Apple products but I canâ€™t justify paying $1,000 for this phone. Seems like they need to bring in people who are more inventive."
I have never been more excited for a film.
I have to plug in headphones just to hear your weasel ass
I heard Evergreen offers the best Gender Studies and Liberal Arts programs for today's youth.
i honestly don't get why people hate easter eggs so much.
I honestly thought I was the only one and that was like are they serious it's official people only buy iPhones for the name iPhone because they don't have anything to offer it's nothing it's full of crap what I don't understand what the hell is that
I hope apple loses money cause after the iPhone 6'its all been shit
I hope Louis Black is watching this.
"I hope the media stays on top of Carson's HUD, any other federal agencies where woefully unqualified cronies have been installed. Their incompetence and results need to be reported so we can see what happens when people think government and experience in government doesn't matter."
I hope to see the Vampire finale in some sort.
I just got a redbull ad of 2 iphones being abandoned by their owners.\n\n\n\n\nI have a feeling they're gonna have some company soon.
I like Ben CarsonðŸ˜Š
I like how when other people say these things its fine but when a famous person says this everyone loses their heads
i like the white hat better than the usual one
I like you logan but your brother is a menace to youtube
I liked the movie ðŸ¤·
I liked the what does the fox say joke
I ll still buy an iphone 6s coz it hs headphone jack and finger print sensor
"I love idolizing football or basketball teams, and would gladly sell my soul in support.  Would I make it at a University like this?"
I love Logan and Jake so much and thay are so amazing and I look up to them so much ðŸ˜ðŸ’‹ðŸ’™ðŸ‘
I love these videos
I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ â¤ï¸
I love you
I love you so much I love to meet you But I live in Israel You really inspire me I really like your channel Keep doing what you do\nBecause everyone loves it and will be Unique and Pashan will be creative and I hope you will see it bye
I loved the CPR joke. A lot.
"I prefer iPhone 8 over 10, â€˜cause iPhone 10 looks like one of those android phones with a similar design. iPhone 8 looks more of a iPhone instead of 10."
I really wanna get that emoji machine..
I really wanna watch this!
I really want to see some kind of video of Wiseau responding to this movie xD
"I remember when Apple was the innovator, every one of those features is available on my Samsung 8. They should've just copied the infinity display too...would've made it look much nicer."
"i saw it and it was alright, but it was just like any other action-romance-comedy, nothing special. the best character was the mummy, but she died and the dark series just began."
I subscribed today. This was only the second video I've watched and I had no idea it was a year special.
I think Ben Carson needs neurosurgery.
I think I prefer the Room itself
"I think it is okay, you are sorry about that and it is done. Strange is, that we have here 2 kind of people. 1 which can say this word with N and nothing happen und the other people where everybody get insane. Just think of it."
i think its funny how he said one word and all of the sudden its the end of the world i get it words hurt but you all need to grow up honestly because i can say this the fact that you get offended by a word is dissapointing like seriously theres so much worse one youtube but no one does anything about that grow up!! and at least he had the decency to own up to what you did he said this to everyone in the entire world lets you get on camara and apologize infront of millions of people i bet you cant do it..
I think other YouTube's who are hatting at him are just jealous that he is bigger than them. I think yes it was wronge for him to say it but common give this guy a break ok I have heard this word said by black people daily if they can say it why can't white people why so sensitive. I am Indian and have heard Sooo much rasisum from every body including black and white people. This is outrageous I am pissed and not happy u can clearly see he was hyped up at the time when he said this can't u actually just support him and understand that he is a human as well
I think people won't complain about the headphone jack if Apple Ships their iPhones with wireless earbuds.
I think the room would have been a better movie if Johnny was a vampire
I think you should do a tie-dye hat
I thought It was from warner brothers
I totally can't wait to see this movie! James Franco does a good job as Tommy Wiseau!
I turned 16 today and still watch your video's.
I want to watch this
"I wanted a better phone, if I wanted a camera I would have bought a Nikon."
"I was attacked by a police dog once, \n\n\n\n\n\nthat was the best use of peanut butter ever."
I was dying when he threw the midget on the ground at the end LMAO
"I was laughing until Seth said the guy is basically dismantling the department. This nation is perfectly capable of building affordable housing for less fortunate, but hey, who cares about them, the money is in multi-million dollar condos."
I was really curious about that iPhone 9 thing too. Apparently it's the iPhone X because it's the ten year anniversary
I was soooo that Dad when I took my daughter to my old university.  Lolz!!!
I was the 50k sub and now this!
"I went to Boston University.  When I would have my spring break, I would pretend to be a Harvard student and go to their classes.  Harvard was fun.  Their lectures were more interesting than ours, which was totally unfair.  I even gave someone else directions one time.  MIT was depressing/suffocating though.  It was a combination of the people and atmosphere.  I only pretended to go there for half a day."
I will not be wearing a case with iPhone X
i will not intentionally do anything to benefit...any...american! only russians!
I will sub back EVERYONE that subs too me and likes this comment! Comment when done!
I wish Ben Carson was my grandpa...
I worked at a top NYC hospital and the neurosurgeons were loons.
I worry about certain games that require you to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to play and that might constantly trigger the back to home screen function.
I would rather buy a brand new PC
I...Don't think I could go to college.\nIt would not end well.
"IdiÃ³ta, iphone majmolÃ³ barmok!!!!!!"
idiot
Idubbbz says niggerfaggot in like every single video a year ago and it's hilarious. Everyone's such a boner. Love you Felix
If a black american says the n word it's called slang. If a black american can call us white people or typical white girls it's called fun. But if a white person says the n word he's a racist. K den
"If Apple never named their iPhones with an s and numbered it like Air Jordan shoes every year, the iPhone X would have been released last year. Now after releasing 14 different iPhone models, it's confusing having an 8 and 10 but no 9.\n\nThis is what Apple should have done without s naming.. \n\n2007 - iPhone\n2008 - iPhone II instead of 3G\n2009 - iPhone III instead of 3Gs\n2010 - iPhone IV \n2011 - iPhone V instead of 4s\n2012 - iPhone VI instead of 5\n2013 - iPhone VII instead of 5s\n2014 - iPhone VIII instead of 6\n2015 - iPhone IX instead of 6s\n2016 - iPhone X instead of 7\n2017 - iPhone XI instead of 8 & X\n\nOnly the first iPhone and iPhone 4 were named properly. Poor iPhone 9 and 7 doesn't get an s model. Next year, remove the numerics and refer to it only as iPhone the same way the numerics no longer exist for iPads or a MacBook."
If I could only afford one...
"If u are really sorry, donate money to africa that you got from making this video."
"If you drop these phones, you're lucky if both glass panels don't shatter simultaneously...screen and back. But iPhone buyers have enough money anyway...so it hits no beggars. lol"
"If you forget the gimmicky bezeless front, the iPhone X is lowkey trash"
if you get allot of diss likes do you get on the top comments? lets see diss like this please
If you look at the top you can see the camera they're using to film the iPhone is seeing the IR blasts coming from the sensor.
If your not black you have no right to say that word point blank period
I'll take the 3 switches and 2 games please

I'm just not impressed
"I'm not an apple fan, had iPhones for years in the past before being overcome with boredom stemming from the stagnant design and underwhelming yearly reveals. Currently loving on my gorgeous s8 plus, HOWEVER, the iPhone X is absolutely beautiful, and for the first time in years I'm actually kind of excited about an apple product. Also can't wait to see how Samsung responds, competition means better products for consumers. Nice work apple:)"
im not going to lie but those hat look ridiculously awesome \nrainbow section new hats  like next is rainbow
I'm so glad I'm an old fart who never has to go to school again. Woo Hoo!
I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say the wait is tearing me apart.
im watching this at college
I'm white ok I don't know if it really is offensive at all. BUT HOW THE FUCK DOES HIM SAYING THIS AFFECT YOU AT ALL. He didn't say anything about someone trying to be mean to them. Y'all need to chill.

inept is putting it mildly
Insert the room quote here ðŸ‘‡ðŸ»
Intro sounds like it belongs in Splatoon. :P
"iPhone 10. If you're going to use numerals for your prior devices numerals it is. Now if they had revealed the iPhone VIII and iPhone VIII+, then I would use X as in x-ray. Either way, I won't be going to a phone that only allows facials for biometrics."
iPhone 10... of COURSE...

"iPhones are for cool hip people, and Samsungs/androids are for fob immigrants and old people, that's what I've noticed"
"is about ego, status and power."
Is it just me or does the iPhone X frame look chunkier compared to the S8+?
Is it just me or is Rekha really cute?
is it just or did you hear the guy saying the dog has a high risk of injury and one dude had to get surgery.
Is this... UCLA?
Isn't it time for a Wonder Woman honest trailer?
It did not take a bunch of tries for Tommy to get his lines right. This movie is already gonna he inaccurate and terrible.
It has 2 colors u cant afford it ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
It is Trump's goal to dismantle the US government and leave it in so much chaos that Russia is able to become the largest super power again.
It looks like a Samsung
"It looks like glass iPhone,,, that effect is not for me,,, ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸŽ death"
"It's a liberal arts school Sweetie , get your ass in the car !"

"Its just a word, calm down"

I've been following you from the start of your vine channel and have seen all 365 vlogs
"I've never been prouder, been a subber for like 3 years, and this video got on one of our newssites."
I've said it once and I'll say it again: I only sniff poop not eat it!
Ive said some hateful shit while playing video games and i tend to rage to and in that rage i probably shouldn't have said some stuff that i did but idgaf
Jack speaks the truth
Jacksfilms = sarcasm comedian
Jake Paul ? Who
Jake Paul is the fastest growing channel to hit 10 Million and thats a fact and is u dont want to believe that then just dab away
Jake started YouTube 3 years ago his first vid is 3 years ago so technically Logan hit it first

This comedian is a racist asshole."
Like this or you'll become gay
"Listen listen, it's not up to white people to judge or criticize you for what you said, the word you said it's a offensive slang to black people if anyone has the right to be offended is them. So, please , people on the comments, stop saying it's just a word or I feel offended for them . Let them say what they think about what happened."

"Look at all these poor Shitsung folks in the comments...Â Putting personal preference aside, no matter how you slice it, Apple will come out with the new best-selling phone on the market, again. It will be the fastest phone on the market, again. It will have the most used features, largest and most well-developed App Store, and highest adoption rate of hardware & software out of every single phone on the planet. People will be willing to pay for these devices for years to come, and it all comes from the (non-arguably) brilliant marketing tactics that Apple has been following for years. In the end, none of the debate matters when it's Tim Cook who will be sitting on top of his massive cash pile with the first TRILLION DOLLAR-VALUED company in the world. Can't argue with facts people. BUT, I'm sure you'll find a way!"

my local radio station played an audio clip from your video
"My two biggest disappointments from this event are 1 the iPhone 10 not having a full 2k display and the screen only putting out 625nits of max brightness. That's a little less than half the max brightness of the galaxy note 8. I understand it will Â be better than the Note 8 in lots of other ways, but I wanted it to match or be better in every conceivable way so the android fans wouldn't have anything to hold on to."

Other streamers do the same thing and don't apologize. Here is a prime example of a truly moral person he tries so hard even censors himself to try and be a good example but he makes one tiny mistake and they attack him.  I saw an example where a teachers writes the time tables for 9 he starts by writing 9x1=10 then writes the rest right. The kids make fun because he got one wrong but fail to acknowledge that the rest are correct it goes to show people will quickly make fun of your mistakes but ignore your accomplishments. Keep doing what you're doing pewds you truly are an inspiration
"Paul Ryan has not yet come to terms with the fact that Ayn Rand is power pornography for teenage boys at a certain stage of aching virginity -- and normal kids get over it.\n \nA lot of people throughout RepublicanLand have variations on the same problem.  They really believe a scientifically incorrect notion, that human beings are independent of one another.  It may feel like that for the lonely teenager, but it's never, ever, true.  \n \nFrom that falsehood, they then build up moralities, generally ugly, histories, false, and a subset of both: self-serving aims or purpose.\n\nThis high-minded purpose gives us a HUD Secretary who is opposed to the Department of HUD, a Secretary of Health (named Price!) who believes that all medicine should be commercial.  You've got a guy over at Environmental Protection who is on the side of the folks continuing to dig the hole deeper.

"Pay $1,000 or $1,200 for the 256GB, and not even getting half the full screen experience of a galaxy S8 or S8+. With lower resolution, a notch that blocks your view, and no hard press home button."
"People complaining about the notch are imbeciles. How else were they supposed to go full screen and still fit the speaker grille, sensors & front camera in there? iPhone X is gorgeous, imo."
"People give power to the word they don't want to hear. If someone says the N word, let it slide. Because you're the one who's making it a bigger deal. Stop caring and things will cool off"
People here at work think this phone is the best phone ever made and no other phone has the features it will have.....I sit and listen o them at the lunch table browsing YouTube on my S8 smiling.  :)
People in the coments you are stupid hes an adult its not a mastake he should know not to say it stop defending him all the time
People mad because he said the n word!? He said it by accident cause everyone does it
Pewd you don't have anything to apologize for... it's just a word
pewdiepie had nothing to be sorry about.  everybody who is mad at him need to get their head out of their ass and get over themselves.  or maybe when a black person makes an offensive remark about a white person i should call them racist and see how they like it.  turn about is fair play.
Pewdiepie puts up a sorry video for saying the N word.\n\n90% of the comments are people typing it.
"Pewdiepie... bumass nigga, lmao."
Pewds we are all behind you. This is just another attack on your character. We love you

Police dogs do so much they should be appreciated more. They are so loyal the breeds are typically Malinois and sometimes German shepherds. Malinois are more agile but German shepherds are more powerful. I live shepherds a tad more.
"Poods, irrespective of your intentions (which I genuinely believe are pure and not hateful), you are a public face and voice and what you say and do influences others greatly. It's really disappointing to see that you still struggle to really respect the influence you have on YouTube and to your 57 million audience. I hope you wake the fuck up and stop this shit because you're a good, entertaining guy who really is and should be better than this. I hope you turn things around bro. Be more woke."

Seems like College Season is starting. Anyway...dropout rate is so high.
Seriously? You decide to attack the most prominent black republican representative? When we have all these other huge issues in our current government. Wow. I always knew Seth was Racist. He's just open about it now I guess.
"Seth forgot to add the rampant nepotism at HUD, with Carson's wife and kids attending meetings and making decisions."

So Americans in states that elected Drumpf will need the very 2 agencies - HUD And EPA - that the Drumpf administration vitually dismantled? HAH! Talk about what goes around comes around...
So disappointing this movie was
"so funny, so true"
"So humble! It's ok Pewds, u didn't mean to cause the drama that crowds try to create. U are a good example to your fans."
"So I used to live right in front of the tour room aka mint condition room. Anyway, the thing is many many parents take a an opportunity to peek and even take pictures of our room when clearly someone is in the room!  Please don't open or peak into other people's room! or even try to open closed room! It is common for us to leave our doors slightly open for other dormmates to come by and say hi to hang out! We don't mind if you are in the hallway, but if you push the door like a creep and take a picture? We have a problem. Also, we know for sure that the tour guys have warned to not open our doors or peak inside because they know 1/50 parents do this and out of many tour guys are our own dormmates."
So many people wana see face id security flaw.....
So roman you are NOT going to charge anyone to see this movie you are making right
So thanks apple now I'm confused did they just release the IPhone 8 and 10 at the same time making one obsolete also what's with these software companies and they're hatred of the number 9?!?
So you don't have the one kid who is terrified of the  prospect of his impending future and how much his decisions actually mean despite having 18 years of where he was basically along for the ride and constantly thinks about putting a barrel to their head?â€¦
So. Fucking. True.
So...Cracked basically did the same thing recently JS
"So...we're just going to overlook how advanced technology is becoming to describe you? LOCATION, FINGER PRINTS, FRONT FACING APPLE ID UNLOCK......l'll pass."

"That notch looks horribly ugly, and those gestures will go sooo wrong..."

"The lunatic surrounds himself with other lunatics. America, you have become so bizarre..."
The movie is so bad that Even this honest trailer sucked
The movie was okay
"The phone itself looks pretty great but it isn't worth the $1,000. I'd say wait a while before buying it so the price can lower. By March next year it's probably gonna be the same price as the IPhone 7 is now."
"The phone looks cool on the front but the back and sides look awful, especially with that glass back and how the camera lip is like the Iphone 6 (Not smooth) and not like the Iphone 7 (smooth)."
The pseudo leader of the Wu-tang Clan is the RZA.

they made the mummy too hot.  I would let her kill me...
They should have put the fingerprint scanner on the apple logo on the back of the phone.
They should make a more violent version of this video where the statue is a random black guy
they took gesture tech from blackberry 10 phones. BB was really good. Missing it.

"This phone reminded me of the iphone 3gs, so glad that i got my S8+ for $775"

"To me, it's just a waste of money. Samsung galaxy note 8 is better"
To the people saying that since black people say it why does it matter if another race says it this is one of many reasons why our society is shit now. It doesn't matter if black says it that doesn't justify other groups using the term shit like that doesn't just slip out that's the worst word you can think of ? It's scary how dumb a lot of people are in these comments we've got a lot of work to do America. Some of your reasoning validation his reasoning for using the word is ridiculous. #SMD
"Tom Cruise and Alex Kurtzman were the problems, Universal has 17 months to make adjustments and see what went right and what went wrong with The Mummy before Bride Of Frankenstein hits the big screen."

True true
Trump eliminated the programs we needed the most. Not wise.
Trump literally didn't know who Fredrick Douglas was.  He just recently discovered Lincoln was a Republican (before Republicans switched to being the racist party during the Civil Rights era).  He thought health care was five dollar a month life insurance. He doesn't know how to spell heal.  He's STOOOOOPPID.
"Trump sees HUD primarily as a tool for enriching well-connected real-estate developers, Carsonâ€™s combination of loyalty and ignorance may make him uniquely â€œqualifiedâ€ for the position. ðŸ˜ "
u should get rid the parody
Ugh... 6:30...I'm done LOL
Um well not the best Vlog was expecting more but congrats
"Understand: To some, Trump is the fulfillment of their religious aspirations. Good luck, reality."

"What about the construction of buildings that actually sound cool, but will never be completed until after you finish college."
"What an absolute clown.  It's reflective of the state of our nation that a man like Ben Carson could somehow manage to become a leading candidate for president of the United States.\n\nKudos to Ben Carson for his success as a brain surgeon, but it's fair to remember that politics isn't brain surgery - it's far more difficult."
What are you filming for?
What did he say??
What did he take away from this [trip] today?\nMy luggage!\n\n... but maybe that only adds an extra layer of humour if english is not your mother tongue? ;)
